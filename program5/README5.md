
# PROGRAM 1: Topological Ordering

## (Name): Yafet Kubrom (EUID):11334602

This program takes a directed acyclic graph and display the topological order.\
It will read the single graph from input file `data5.txt` and display the Ordering to `out5.txt`\   

## Assumption

* `data5.txt` must be present in directory.
* The input graph must have at most 50 vertices.
* `out5.txt` is optional. The program will create one if one does not exist.

## Compile & Execute

* **Compile:**  `g++ -o program5 program5.cpp`
* **Run:** `./program5`
